# thehelp-messaging

A lightweight package for sending SMS via Twilio, and email via Sendgrid. Also makes it easy to receive SMS and email from these services.

## Setup

First, install the project as a√ü dependency:

```bash
npm install thehelp-messaging --save
```

Then you'll need to provide your credentials for these services. You can do it in code, but I prefer to set it up with environment variables:

To send email, create a Sendgrid sub-user account here: <https://sendgrid.com/credentials> and use its credentials:

```
"THEHELP_SENDGRID_USERNAME": "username"
"THEHELP_SENDGRID_PASSWORD": "password"
```

To send SMS, grab your Twilio credentials: <https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings>

```
"THEHELP_TWILIO_KEY": "your AccountSID"
"THEHELP_TWILIO_TOKEN": "your AuthToken"
```

We'll save the configuration for receiving SMS and email for a bit later.

## Usage

With that all set up, tt's as easy as this for SMS:

```
var Twilio = require('thehelp-messaging').Twilio;
var twilio = new Twilio();

var sms = {
  From: '+15551000000',
  To: '+15551000000',
  Body: 'my first text mesage!'
};

twilio.send(sms, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
});
```

`Sendgrid` is just a little more complex:

```
var Sendgrid = require('thehelp-messaging').Sendgrid;
var sendgrid = new Sendgrid();

var email = {
  from: 'someone@somewhere',
  to: 'recipient@somewhere',
  subject: 'subject!',
  body: 'Body of the message'
};

sendgrid.send(email, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
});
```

## Tests

You'll need some additional environment variables to run all tests:

```
"NOTIFY_SMS_TO": "integration tests send here",
"NOTIFY_SMS_FROM": "one of your twilio account's 'from' numbers",
"NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO": "integration tests send here",
"NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM": "email will be 'from' this email account"
```
